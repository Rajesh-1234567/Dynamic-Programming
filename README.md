# Dynamic-Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for efficiently solving a broad range of search and optimization problems which exhibit the property of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. It is used in both mathematics and computer science to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

The key idea behind dynamic programming is to solve each subproblem only once and store the solutions to overlapping subproblems in a table, so that when the same subproblem arises, you can simply look up the previously computed solution, rather than recomputing it. This can significantly reduce the time complexity of a solution.
